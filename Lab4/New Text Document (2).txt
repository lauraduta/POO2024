structures
diff between structures and class - privacy => classes are private, structures are public
Student:
- name = char size-1 (ex: ionut => i) => char* (pointer)
- id = int
- address = char*
- email = char*(dynamic)/char[](static) 
- phone = char[] (here we use static bc we know the length for phone no)
